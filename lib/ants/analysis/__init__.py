"""
Many of the routines you will need to perform the processing of
source data into an ancillary field are found in :mod:`ants.analysis`.
You can also call iris routines to help your ancillary field
processing. Some ANTS functions are relatively minimal wrappers around
iris functions.  Where appropriate, call the ANTS functions as these
provide additional benefits such as updating meta-data on the cubes.

Some of the most common routines you will want to use are:

* Calculating the area weighted mean of a field
  using :func:`~ants.analysis.mean`
* Filling a field to ensure it has values on every
  land/ocean/both point using :func:`~ants.analysis.UMSpiralSearch`.
* Merging two datasets using :func:`~ants.analysis.merge`.

Note, ANTS merge is used in a different context to iris.  In ANTS it means
combining two data sources either

1. to build a larger coverage than the source data or
2. to embed a high quality local source within a dataset with greater
   coverage.

The meaning in iris is discussed in the `iris documentation
<https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/merge_and_concat.html>`_.

    Merges data from the alternative cube into the primary cube.

    The primary cube data is used as a base, then cells from the alternate

    primary at those locations.  Containment is defined as any cell corner
    which lies within the polygon.  "Within" explicitly does not include
    those points which exactly lay on the polygon boundary.  Where multiple
    primary and alternate cubes are provided, then these are paired
    appropriately where possible.  Where these datasets are not defined on the
    same grid, the user should consider a regrid first to then utilise merge.

    Parameters
    ----------
    primary_cube : :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` or :class:`~iris.cube.CubeList`
        The primary dataset which has a highest priority i.e. overriding values
        in the alternate dataset.
    alternate_cube : :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` or :class:`~iris.cube.CubeList`
        The alternate data set which is to be merged, taking a lower priority

    validity_polygon : :class:`~collections.abc.Iterable` or \
        :class:`shapely.Polygon` instance, optional
        Polygon defining the region of valid data within the primary dataset.
        Data defined outside this region will not take preference of the
        alternate dataset.  The crs of the polygon is assumed to be the same as
        the primary dataset to which it describes.  If an iterable is provided,
        then each item should correspond to the x, y point definition.
        If not provided, the entire primary_cube dataset is considered valid
        (including masked value).  This means that the two datasets are
        stacked together with the primary_cube taking priority over
        alternate_cube in the case of an overlap. A runtime error will be
